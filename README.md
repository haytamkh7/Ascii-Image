This mini project is inspired by one of Robert Heaton's list of projects and it is coded in Java.

The program:
1. Loads an image (using OpenCV library for image processing)
2. Loads all the pixels into 2D array
3. Converts each pixel tuple (RGB) into a brightness number
4. Maps each brightness number to a corresponding ASCII character
5. Prints the ASCII characters to a .txt file where the ASCII art is displayed
